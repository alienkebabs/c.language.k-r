Revise the main routine of the longest line program so it will correctly print the length of arbitrary long input lines, and as much as possible of the text.

This is pretty difficult I think because they haven't gone through memory managemnt in C yet and I think it is important if you want to have variable length arrays. I guess I will start off by typing out the longest line function in section 1.9 and have a think.
