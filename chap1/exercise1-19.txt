Write a function reverses that reverses the character string s. Use it to write a program that reverses its input one line at a time.
So we will need to find the end of a string and then because we are using a function we will need to iterate through and return the reversed string.
Pseudocode is,
(read in a line of text)
    find the length of the string
    loop backwards from the end of the string to the start
    add a \0 character at the end
