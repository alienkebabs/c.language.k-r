Write a program to print all input lines that are longer than 80 characters.

So this is the pseudocode I have. I will start writing code in longLines.c

while (there's another line)
if (it's longer than 80 characters)
	(append it to the end of the text that will be printed
	include the newline characters)
print all of the lines
